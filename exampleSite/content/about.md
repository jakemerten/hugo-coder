An environmental scientist using the virtual world to solve problems in the physical one. I primarily use Python/SQL; visualize in PowerBI/D3.js.

## Interests 

I enjoy a plethora of outdoor activities including trail running, backpacking, mountaineering, kayaking, climbing, and mountain biking. I like to read and play strategy video games.

## Current Focus

I am in the process of delving deeper into back-end development using Python. I am hoping to parlay my previous programming knowledge to create easy to use products that serve as a valuable endpoint for analyzing large data sets.

## In 5 years...

I want to be a backend developer helping to create useful tools and further user efficiency. I believe that data is the future and embracing it will pave the path through many problems.
